## Main Menu
In the main menu, you can see all the saved links, your folders, including favorites' folders, and the different features available in the top bar. You can press the icons in the top bar to go to configuration, search for a link, sort your links and add new ones.

If you press a link button, your phone will open your navigator and go to the saved link. If you long-press or hold, the link will be copied to your clipboard. You can also press the three little dots on the card to unfold a little bar in which there are options to configure your link. You can add it to a folder, add it to favorites, share it, edit it or delete it.

## Add link
If you press the icon "+" in the main menu, you'll be navigating to a new screen, on which you can add a new link. You have to insert the name and the web link, if you don't give a name, the link will take the web link as a name. You can also select a folder to save it and mark the link as private so you can only see it if you put your phone password (or your preferred unblocking method).
If you try to go back without saving the link, an alert dialog will appear, warning you.
